PROJECT: Cyberpunk Personal Portfolio

VISION:
Build a stunning, futuristic personal portfolio website with a cyberpunk aesthetic.
The site should feel like stepping into a neon-lit digital world — think Blade Runner
meets a hacker's terminal.

HERO SECTION:
- Full-viewport glitch-effect hero with animated text distortion
- My name rendered in a monospace font with a flickering CRT scanline overlay
- Tagline: "Full-Stack Engineer // Digital Architect // Code Artisan"
- A subtle matrix-style rain of characters falling behind the text
- Neon accent colors: electric cyan (#00f0ff) and hot magenta (#ff00a8)
- On hover, the hero text should "glitch" with random offset frames

SECTIONS:
1. About — A terminal-style "boot sequence" that types out my bio on scroll
2. Projects — Holographic-style cards with a 3D tilt effect on hover, each card
   showing a project screenshot with a neon border glow
3. Skills — Circular progress rings with animated fill, styled like a HUD interface
4. Experience — A vertical timeline with pulsing neon dots and glassmorphism cards
5. Contact — A form styled as a command-line interface (e.g., "> Enter your name_")

TECH PREFERENCES:
- Framework: Next.js 14 with App Router
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom cyberpunk theme
- Animations: Framer Motion for scroll-triggered reveals
- Dark mode only (this IS the theme)
- Fully responsive — mobile must feel like a handheld cyberdeck

EXTRAS:
- Custom cursor that leaves a neon trail
- Page transition effects with a "loading data..." screen
- Easter egg: Konami code triggers a "system hack" animation
- Sound effects (toggleable) for button clicks and section transitions
